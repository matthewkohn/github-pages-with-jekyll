# A lot has happened.
## Let's get caught up.

Hi there. Please allow me to introduce myself. 

My name is **Matt**, and I live in *Vail, Colorado*. 

I love exploring, traveling, camping, road tripping, and getting lost. I excellent beard-growing skills, and I have an amazing cookie recipe that you can't have.
But, if you ask nicely, I might make you some cookies.

Once upon a time I graduated from CSU with a B.A. in sociology. After considering my options, I chose one winter in Vail over Grad School.
I moved here for that one winter about eight years ago, and then summer happened. And camping, fishing, climbing, rafting, and hiking. And then one more winter happened. And so on. 

I love living in the mountains. 
On one side I live in a tourist community, a rich variety of priveledged people and a huge ski resort that has sustained me financially and recreationally.

I've worked in restaurants my entire adult life.
I love making food and creating amazing drinks. I love meeting new people and hearing their stories.
I love creating experiences.

And then, the COVID-19 pandemic happened last March. Life as we knew it came to a screeching halt.
Everything closed down. The chairlifts stopped. The restaurants and bars closed. At first it was for a couple of weeks, which slowly turned into months.
I was out of work with a lot of free time on my hands and nothing to really "do".

So I started taking online classes, because why not.
The first class I signed up for was edX's CS50 at Harvard with David Malan. At first I chipped away at the videos, trying to understand what was going on.
I had a lot of catching up to do, and that I did. I made it halfway through the course when the restaurants re-opened in May.

When we first re-opened, social distancing and mask wearing was being invented.

It was horrible. 

People were insane. 

We were asking for consideration, and literally got spit at.

I asked my boss if I could work only 2 dinner shifts a week to stay afloat and not drain my savings in one go.

I signed up for Codecademy Pro in July, and committed myself to learn how to make web pages. 
I loved learning to code so much, and I could see myself being immensely happier doing it for a living.

And so I started down this long and windy road.

Now, I spend every day in front of the computer, soaking in all I can. And I'm so happy doing it.

My curriculum is a blend of concurrent web development programs from Codecademy, Udemy (Brad Traversy & Angela Yu, among others), FreeCodeCamp, MDN, and Sololearn on mobile.
I've found that utilizing multiple sources fills in a lot of small holes in my understanding.

It's taking longer this way, compared to College or a Boot Camp, but I fully intend to have a deep and rich understanding of what I'll be doing as a Developer.

The learning process is a learning process in and of itself. At first, I cruised through HTML and CSS and jumped right into JavaScript.
After stumbling over so many unfinished projects, I had to re-dedicate my full attention to CSS until I had it down. 
I still don't, not yet, but I know how to figure out what I don't know.
I'm progressing again with JavaScript, still refining what I know in CSS, and this Spring I plan on moving into Bootstrap and React.

I have a lot to do, so I'd better get back to it. I have to work at the restaurant in a few hours (it is Superbowl Sunday).
Before I go, today I am learning how to use GitHub. 

The more I work at it, the more firmly I understand. I've got this.
