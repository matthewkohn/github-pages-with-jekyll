# It's nice to potentially meet you.

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my coding journey.

I am committed to the #100daysofcode challenge on Twitter. After this 100 is over, I'll do another. And another.
More than that, I'm committed to learning how to become a React web developer.
Once I am proficient at that, I'd like to learn more frameworks and expand my skill base.
I'd also like to learn more about back-end development as I progress.
Someday, I will be a full stack developer.

I've also thought about exploring AWS cloud certification and data science in the future.
I'm curious about AI, machine learning, cryptocurrency, robotics, and cyber security.

The possibilities are limitless.

I thrive on learning and solving problems.
I'm fueled by figuring out things I don't know. I want to know everything!
